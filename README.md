# Machine Learning and Django
The purpose of this project was to build a Machine Learning model that predicts income level based on census data, and then to deploy that model to a Django server. In this project I utlized the Random Forest and Extra Trees algorithms for machine learning predictions, and built a django server that had interactivity using REST API. Finally, I ran an A/B test to see which algorithm (random forest vs extra trees) yielded better results.
